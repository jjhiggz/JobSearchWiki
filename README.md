# JobSearchWiki

A wiki on approaching the job market.

## Colaborator Instructions

- Clone the repo, don't fork it
  
  ``` bash
  git clone git@github.com:jjhiggz/JobSearchWiki.git
  ```

- Make sure that you have the most up to date version of the project every time you come to work on it

``` bash
git pull origin master

```

- checkout a branch where you can work on, or add something

  ``` bash
    git checkout -b <name of your branch>
  ```

- Try to be careful about what you name your branch so it becomes easier to know what you are actually doing during that session. For example let's say you want to modify the readme.

    ``` bash
    git checkout -b modifying_readme
    ```

- When you are done with your edits, you need to push to the head of your branch. 

    ``` bash
    git push origin <branch name>
    ```

- In our example this would be 

    ``` bash
    git push origin modifying_readme
    ```

- Then you need to go into the gitHub GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) and make a pull request. DO NOT APPROVE THE PULL REQUEST YOURSELF!!!
